## Visualization of NBP currency exchange rates ðŸ’±

During the Advanced Object-Oriented and Functional Programming classes, together with [@AnnaOstrowska](https://github.com/annaostrowska03) and [@MaciejMomot](https://github.com/MaciejMomot), we created a desktop application visualizing the exchange rates of currencies from the National Bank of Poland. The data is retrieved in real-time using the NBP API and presented through several charts. 

The application was written in Java using JavaFX.
